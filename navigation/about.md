## As a conversation Starter

Here are some places I have lived.

However I am not as good as the template can do so I will just list the places I lived in
I have lived in Shanghai, and San Diego, both places starting with an S, and both places near the ocean!!

### Things I am intrested in

Some things I am intrested in are procrastinating and playing video games :D
Some video games I play are proseca and ZZZ, and I suck at both!
One of the things I enjoy is computers and it is possibly one of the reasons why I took this class :D

### Culture, Family, and Fun

## Im also going to do this later because class is about to end

Everything for me, as for many others, revolves around family and faith. Oh, to stay in context of this site ... don't forget I like code, code, coding.

- My mother told me that I was Danish, English. and Irish, here is my researched [family tree]({{site.baseurl}}/images/about/familytree.png)
- My family is pretty big as I have been married twice, my 1st wife passed away.  We have had 5 kids, 4 adopted by me, 1 biological.  Plus, there are three grandkids.  My name to my grandkids is Abuilito.
- The gallery of pics has some of my family, fun, culture and faith memories.
